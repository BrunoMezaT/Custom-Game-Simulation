# Custom-Game-Simulation
Program that simulates a game I made up using 2 different colored dice and a deck of cards without face cards.
A player would roll two d20s and simulataneously select two cards from the deck.
The conditions to win would be:
-Getting over 10 on both dice
-Getting over 6 on both cards
-Getting over 8 on a die and two cards of the same color as that die
-Getting over 15 on a die and two cards of the same color as that die over 5
